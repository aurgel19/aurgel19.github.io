							<h1>Aianne Urgel</h1>
							<h2>Software Engineer and Game Developer</h2>
							<p>I am a self-motivated and driven software engineer and game developer who is passionate about the ability to tell meaningful stories 
								through video games. My interest in tackling the unique challenges inherent to creating impactful games led to me pursuing a career 
								in the game industry. As a software engineer, I've honed the skill of implementing complex features by breaking big problems down 
								into bite-sized pieces and knowing how to ask the right questions. As a game developer, I am skilled at analyzing how various 
								elements of a game can contribute to its overall experience. Video games have incredible potential as a storytelling medium and 
								I strive to create amazing experiences for players that inspire them to create even more games that tell even more amazing stories.</p>
